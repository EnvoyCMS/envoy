# Envoy CMS

A code-first, developer-friendly, open source content management system built
on open-source software, open-standards and best practice for customisability,
extendability and maintainability.

## Comparison

Envoy CMS builds on ideas from other content management systems, yet, without
intending to further convolute the CMS sphere this CMS addresses different but
similar problems.
