# Envoy CMS

A code-first, developer-friendly, open source content management system built
on open-source software, open-standards and best practice for customisability,
extendability and maintainability.

## Key Features of Envoy CMS

- Whitepaper Content Management System
- Code-first structural approach
- No arbitrary errors to fix - nothing like: \
  `[14:22:59] ERROR (xxx): 1: Collection "page" > Field "layout" > "value" does not match any of the allowed types`

## Comparison

Envoy CMS builds on ideas from other content management systems, yet, without
intending to further convolute the CMS sphere this CMS addresses different but
similar problems.
