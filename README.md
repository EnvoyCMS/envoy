# Envoy CMS

A code-first, developer-friendly, open source content management system built
on open-source software, open-standards and best practice for customisability,
extendability and maintainability.

**Works with all major
[static site generators][source-jamstack-static-site-generators]
and client applications.**

## Key Features of Envoy CMS

- Whitepaper Content Management System
- Code-first structural approach

## Comparison

Envoy CMS builds on ideas from other content management systems, yet, without
intending to further convolute the CMS sphere this CMS addresses different but
similar problems.

When considering a Content Management System, you should consider the options
available, of which there are many - a good place to start off your comparison
efforts is Netlify's Jamstack website detailing some options in regards to
[headless content management systems][source-jamstack-headless-cms].
