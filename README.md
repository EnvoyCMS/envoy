# Envoy CMS

A code-first, developer-friendly, open source content management system built
on open-source software, open-standards and best practice for customisability,
extendability and maintainability.

## Comparison

Envoy CMS builds on ideas from other content management systems, yet, without
intending to further convolute the CMS sphere this CMS addresses different but
similar problems.

### Key Features of Envoy CMS

- Whitepaper Content Management System
- Code-first structural approach

### Envoy CMS vs Payload CMS

> **Note from the author of Envoy CMS:**
>
> “Payload CMS is a very strong content management system with strong community
> support and very strong featureset. I worked, personally, for a while with
> Payload CMS, however, working with NextJS I simply ran into too many walls
> trying to create dynamic endpoints working with sharp. Working with all the
> types from Payload CMS, I ended up running into too many walls trying to get
> my solution working - even with plugins and customisations, I just had too
> hard of a time trying to get something working in the way that I was hoping
> it would.”

### Envoy CMS vs Keystone CMS

> **Note from the author of Envoy CMS:**
>
> “Another strong Content Management System I personally worked with is
> Keystone CMS - and, similarly to Payload CMS, it was a system that I
> strongly hoped would be able to support the features that i was looking for.
> The structural makeup was a strong inspiration for that of Envoy CMS.
> Keystone CMS is another strong competitor in the Content Management space.”
