# Keystone CMS

[Keystone CMS][tech-keystone] is a powerful GraphQL-based headless
content management system built with TypeScript and strong access control,
session management, database migrations, filtering, relational data support and
automated CRUD.

> **Note from the author of Envoy CMS:**
>
> “Another strong Content Management System I personally worked with is
> Keystone CMS - and, similarly to Payload CMS, it was a system that I
> strongly hoped would be able to support the features that i was looking for.
> The structural makeup was a strong inspiration for that of Envoy CMS.
> Keystone CMS is another strong competitor in the Content Management space.”
