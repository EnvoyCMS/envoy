# Envoy CMS vs Payload CMS

[Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/) is an open-source, headless, content
management system for websites, web apps, native apps, e-commerce,
subscriptions and omnichannel content distribution.

> **Note from the author of Envoy CMS:**
>
> “Payload CMS is a very strong content management system with strong community
> support and very strong featureset. I worked, personally, for a while with
> Payload CMS, however, working with NextJS I simply ran into too many walls
> trying to create dynamic endpoints working with sharp. Working with all the
> types from Payload CMS, I ended up running into too many walls trying to get
> my solution working - even with plugins and customisations, I just had too
> hard of a time trying to get something working in the way that I was hoping
> it would.”
